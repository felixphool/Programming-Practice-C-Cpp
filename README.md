# Programming-Practice-C-Cpp
An old archive of competitive coding problems I solved to practice and polish my C, C++ skills 

I created it to contain the codes from vaious different languages like C, C++, Java(<1%), etc.


These codes are based on various concepts of programming right from OOPS, DSA, Competitive codeing, pattern matching, etc. If you are new to coding, and want to get your hands on something simple initially, this might be a good place to start.


There are different folders created for codes of each language and are numbered serially for convinience. *pats on back for awesome organizing skills*


The Assignments folder contains codes for multiple competitive programming concepts and company asked questions. These codes are written in primarily 3 lanuages namely C, C++ and Java.


To run the codes of C language, use the command:
1. gcc program_name.c -o Myexe
2. ./Myexe


To run the codes of C++ language, use the command:
1. g++ program_name.cpp -o Myexe
2. ./Myexe


To run the codes of Java language, use the command:
1. javac program_name.java
2. java program_name

If I could be of any help, I'd love to help a peer out! Contact me on my email ID (pinned on my profile). Have fun!
